/*
The last challenge created an object with various properties, now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
// This prints "Aflac" to the console
Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of "Aflac".


Print both properties of the dog object below to your console.
*/

let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.numLegs);
